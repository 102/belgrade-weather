# Weather Data Logger

## Description
**Weather Data Logger** is a Deno-based application that captures and logs weather data from a JSON file into a CSV format. This allows users to maintain a historical record of weather conditions, making it easy to analyze trends over time. 

This project is designed as a lightweight solution for personal or small-scale weather tracking and is not intended for serious research purposes.

## Features
- **Data Logging**: Reads weather data from a JSON file and appends it to a CSV file.
- **Input Validation**: Ensures that the JSON input has the expected structure and that the temperature is within a realistic range.
- **Duplicate Detection**: Prevents duplicate entries in the historical data based on date and temperature.
- **Error Handling**: Provides clear error messages for issues encountered during file operations.
- **Help Command**: Offers a built-in help command to guide users on how to use the application.
